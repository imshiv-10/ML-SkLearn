Introduction to supervised machine learning, decision trees, and gradient boosting using Python.

Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used for predicting a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables. The logistic function is used to model the probability of the outcome being 1 or 0 given the independent variables. Logistic regression is used in classification problems.
