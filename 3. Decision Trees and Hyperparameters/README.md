# Decision Trees and Random Forests


Decision trees and random forests are two related machine learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks.

A decision tree is a tree-like model that makes predictions by starting at the root node, evaluating a test condition on the input features, and moving down the tree based on the result of the test until it reaches a leaf node, which represents a prediction. The tree is constructed by recursively splitting the data into smaller groups based on the feature that results in the best split, as measured by a impurity criterion such as the Gini Index or information gain.

A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees, where multiple decision trees are trained on random subsets of the data and the predictions are combined to produce a final prediction. This can lead to improved accuracy and reduced overfitting compared to a single decision tree, as the randomness in the training data and the combining of predictions helps to reduce the impact of overfitting in any one tree.

In summary, decision trees are a simple and interpretable algorithm, but can easily overfit the data. Random forests are an extension of decision trees that improve accuracy and reduce overfitting by combining the predictions of many decision trees trained on different subsets of the data.
