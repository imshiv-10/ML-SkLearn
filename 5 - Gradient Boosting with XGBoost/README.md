# Gradient Boosting with XGBoost

Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosting that is designed for speed and performance. It stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting and it's an optimized version of gradient boosting algorithm which is highly efficient and scalable. XGBoost uses parallel processing, regularization, and early stopping to prevent overfitting, which often results in higher accuracy and faster training times compared to other gradient boosting libraries.
